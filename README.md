# Rock-Paper-Scissors-gh
This is a task to create a simple version of the game using Python i.e Player(user) vs CPU(device).

About:

There are 3 options
"R" for "Rock"
"P" for "Paper"
"S" for "Scissors"

Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper

1) When the program runs it asks the player to pick an option from "R", "P", and "S".
2) If the user's input is invalid, it prints out an error message and then returns to Step 1.
3) The choice function from the inbuilt Python 'random' module is used to make the choice for the CPU-player (i.e computer).
4) Once a valid input is made by the user, the program prints out the players' move in the format 'Player(Rock) : CPU (Paper)".
5) if there is a winner, it prints out the winner and the program ends.
6) If its a tie, it prints out a message notifying the user of the tie and restarts the game from Step 1.
